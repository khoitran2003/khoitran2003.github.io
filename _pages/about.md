👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year graduate student at the HCMUT, majoring in Petroleum Engineering.

🔬 My research interests are in bridging vision and language modalities and Self-Supervised Learning!

📚 I'm currently working towards my individual projects in the field of Vision-Language-Modelling.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.


## 📜 Reimplementing
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Transformer, and Tracknet paper into the personal project and extended some features to users to experience.

Optimize the model to achieve the desired business metrics and apply MLOps knowledge to deploy the model

Feel free to review my specific [portfolio entry](/portfolio/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently, I am researching my own **multimodal** model and collaborating with other students to create software to support people with disabilities

## 📚 Other Experience
I had experience in teaching for secondary students and they have had promising results in national competitions
